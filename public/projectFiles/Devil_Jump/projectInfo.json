  "summary": "A game that mixes the concept of the game \"Doodle Jump\" with fighting against characters from the Bible. Implemented with custom platforming logic and weighted randomness to increase replayability and keep development costs low.\n\nThe elevator pitch for this game would be \"What if Doodle Jump, but you fight Jesus?\".\n Granted, that pitch would be for the quickest elevator ride ever, but it is pretty much what the game could be defined as in its simplest terms.",
