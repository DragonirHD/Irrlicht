        This website is a place for me to upload and document my projects.
        <br>
        <br>
        There's currently not much around, but I intend to keep expanding this page, to maybe use it in the future as
        homepage for a game studio. If you see some mismatched text, that's just preparation for the switch from private
        homepage to game studio page.
        <br>
        <br>
        While you're already here, make sure to check out some of my <a [routerLink]="['projects']">projects</a> and
        explore the website a bit.
        <br>
        <br>
        Have fun ^^

        We do not intend to limit ourselves to one singular style.
        Our art direction changes case by case according to what we think would support the underlying gameplay best.

      but you just reading this already means much to us.

      If you like our projects, you can let us know over on our social media channels. (Will be added in the future)

      <b>This website is being made with Angular and Angular Material.</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      The components are all mostly made in house and without any code written by AI. This is done to build up and
      increase our own knowledge about web design and to give the website a unique and custom feel.
      <br>
      <br>
      The website is built with a responsive design that supports mobile devices of sizes down to 360px and also comes
      with dark-/light-mode that automatically adjusts to the users preferences.
