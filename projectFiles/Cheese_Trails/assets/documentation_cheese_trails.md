# Idea and Concept

This game was made for an entry-assignment for the Game Design course at ZHdK.

The theme given for the assignment was: Spur / Trace.

After a lot of brainstorming, I came up with the idea for a game where you play a little mouse that ventures below the floorboards to follow the scent trail (aka. Geruchsspur) of a cheese wedge.

I decided to implement this idea because I found the concept very unique and interesting, and I thought that it would fit well to a sort of cozy/low stakes game, which would probably be appreciated by many during the current turbulent times.  
Playing something to escape the reality of daily life is one of the oldest reasons for playing video games, so I wanted to allow people to take a breather by playing my game and just for a bit, forget their troubles.

There’s currently also a growing trend of going back to old tech. This is also happening in the gaming industry, as people are fed up with current AAA games, having way too much content, aggressively trying to sell you additional things in their in-game stores, and trying to bind you to their game with battle passes and daily/weekly quests.  
With this game, I aimed to create something that mirrors the simplicity and straightforwardness of older games. This idea also influenced my design choices, as I used simple games from the 2000-2010 era as references.

There’s also a more personal reason why I chose to implement this concept. The idea of chasing after something that leads you out of your comfort zone and into unknown areas while also not fully knowing what awaits you at the end resonated with me, as it somewhat mirrors my path of getting into game design.

# Story

You play as a mouse out in the forest. On one of your strolls through the forest, you notice a peculiar smell.

A very smelly smell.

Intrigued, you follow the smell to one of the houses near the edge of the forest. From a pipe protruding out of the houses basement you smell it again.

That same smelly smell.

Do you enter the house and follow the scent? You’ve never known anything other than the forest, and you don’t know what could be hiding in that house.

But that smelly smell does smell quite good.

# Gameplay

In Cheese Trails you wind your way through small corridors and dangerous pathways to get to your price: A magnificent Cheese Wedge.

Watch out for enemies and don't get lost on your way to your goal.  
Fortunately, the cheese has left a path behind for you to follow, but a mouse cannot always go where a cheese can, so be careful.

Find all secrets and collectibles in each level and quickly find the cheese to get the best score.

# Characters

## Mouse

An innocent little mouse travelling through the floorboard in search of the source of the smell. Scared and curious, it ventures into this new territory.

## Wind Up Mouse

Wind up toys, lost for an unknown amount of time. Without aim, they travel on a set path, always turning without any hope for change. You’d almost feel bad for them, if they weren’t so frequently blocking your way.

# Design

The art design of the game is inspired by the fully top-down style games like “Hotline Miami” or “Grand Theft Auto 2”. I found the full top-down approach very interesting and thought that it would help a lot with the level design, keeping the assets simple and making the level layout more readable, as compared to a more traditional isometric / angled top-down approach.

The overall feel of the game is inspired by Nintendo games of the Wii era. I wanted to keep the design family friendly and combine it with some of the wacky and unusual ideas that Nintendo games often have.
Additionally, I selected the music tracks and sound effects to fit the style of those games.
The player movement and the sort of movement-based puzzles that my game has are also inspired by the Nintendo game “Wii Play: Tanks!”

All the assets, sprites and tilesets are custom made by me using Aseprite.

I wanted to keep the art style of the game consistent and also be able to have elements which would only be found in this “under the floorboards”-environment. Due to those points and because I wanted to learn more about making tilesets, I chose to abstain from using pre-made tilesets and assets.

# Score

The scoring system is inspired by some early two-thousands phone games, primarily the game “Cut the Rope”.
I wanted to give the player a secondary objective in the levels, so that they need to explore the level a bit and cannot just always follow the scent trail. For this, I used collectibles that are hidden throughout the level, and that might be a bit harder to reach. Finding all collectibles in a level will upgrade the score.
I also wanted to encourage players to try to optimize their path throughout the level and replay levels even if they have found everything. To accomplish this, I added another factor to the score which depends on the time difference between the players run and a predefined time for each level.

With this scoring system, I reward finishing a level, fully exploring a level, and finding the best path through a level. Each reward is a bit more difficult to get, which should help with players enjoying the game, even if they have drastically different skill levels. Novice level players can still finish the levels and just get the first reward, while more advanced players can aim to always get all rewards.

# AI Usage Declaration

AI was mainly used in this project as additional resource in problem solving during programming tasks or as help with issues regarding the Unity interface.

AI was not used during asset/image creation, animation, ideation or any other part of the creative process.
